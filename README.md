# java-to-python

A learning repo that contains code snippets for Java and Python. 

Python code is implemented in Juptyer Notebooks (files that have .ipynb extensions) or executed at command line (files that have .py extension) using *python filename*. Only python 3.x code considered. Java code is compiled at command line using *javac filename.java* and then run at command line using *java filename*.
