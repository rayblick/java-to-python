# Conditional Logic

## Content
This directory contains a .java file and a .py file containing a little 
conditional logic. The logic is evaluated using an "if else" statement, and the 
implementation is carried out using a single class and one method. This is
 to make sure that attention is given to the logic as the primary 
difference in syntax. All files are executed at command line.

## TLDR
```
|| in java == or in python  
&& in java == and in python  
order of precedence: brackets, then equality, then and, then or
```

## Logic covered  
```python  
A or B  
A and B  
A or B or C  
... 
```

## Run
```bash
javac ConditionalLogic.java  
java ConditionalLogic   
python3 ConditionalLogic.py  
```
